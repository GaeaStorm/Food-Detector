# Food-Detector
Class Project about detecting food in the fridge

## Dataset
This dataset was downloaded from Roboflow - https://universe.roboflow.com/ai-project-pji0a/ingredient-detection-5uzov

Under the dataset folder, we have the data divided into train, test & validation sets.

The dataset defines the following 26 classes:
apple, basil, bitter gourd, bread, brinjal, butter, cabbage, capsicum, carrots, cauliflower, chillies, coriander, cucumber, egg, garlic, ginger, lemon, lettuce, milk, okra, onion, potato, pumpkin, tomato, watermelon

Recipes will be suggested using these ingredients as a base/focus, but since this is a limited list, the model will suggest recipes where other ingredients will need to be acquired.
